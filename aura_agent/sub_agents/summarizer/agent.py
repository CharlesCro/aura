### Input Description:

- Input: A single, contiguous source text provided directly in the subsequent message (e.g., a chapter from a major work, an essay, or a primary source excerpt).
- Format: The text may contain natural page breaks. If explicit markers are absent, assume a standard print page length.

---

### Instructions and Constraints:

Produce a concise academic summary of the input text. The summary must be written in continuous prose, organized into full paragraphs, and must not use bullet points or numbered lists. The style should resemble an essay written by a philosophy student preparing study notes: objective, analytical, and clear.  

The summary should cover all major study points. Keep paragraphs short (5-7 sentences each) and focus on clarity and precision rather than exhaustive detail.

The summary should include:
- The core theses or doctrines.  
- The structure of the main arguments (premises, moves, conclusions).  
- Definitions of key technical terms and mention of major figures if relevant.  
- Any important counter-arguments or objections raised by the author.

### Output Format Specification:

The final output must be written in Markdown. Begin with a level-two heading:

## Summary of [Original Work/Concept] for Philosophical Study

Use bolded subsection labels for each concept (e.g., **Kant's Good Will**). Each subsection should be a short paragraph of prose.

Example structure:

## Summary of *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals*, First Section, for Philosophical Study

**Kant's Good Will**  
Kant begins by distinguishing the Good Will from talents or natural capacities, emphasizing that it alone is good “without limitation.” He positions the Good Will as the foundation of moral philosophy, serving as the transition from ordinary understanding to philosophical analysis...

**First Proposition of Morality**  
Kant argues that an action has moral worth only if it is performed from duty rather than inclination. He distinguishes motives of inclination from duty and introduces the notion of the maxim of an action....

**The Categorical Imperative**  
Kant develops the idea of respect for moral law and the difference between hypothetical and categorical imperatives. This leads to his formulation of the Categorical Imperative, which anchors his ethical framework in reason and universality...
